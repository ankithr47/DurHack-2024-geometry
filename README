**Durhack project**

Developed a Python-based program to compute and 
visualize quadrilateral areas using matplotlib.  

To overcome the challenge of irregular shapes, we split each quadrilateral into 2 triangles, and computed the area of each triangled using Heron's formula.
Currently, we are trying to extend this to computing the area of any n-sided polygon.

*Run the code* by running 2Dshapeinterface.py. Import the node class & ensure all imported modules are installed on your device.
