Durhack project, Developed a Python-based program to compute and 
visualize quadrilateral areas using matplotlib.  

To get around irregular shapes, we decided to split each quadrilateral
into 2 triangles, and computed the area of each triangled using Heron's formula

Currently, we are trying to extend this to compute the area of any n-sided polygon.
